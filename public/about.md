This is a meta-MOOC, a gently curated catalog of free learning resources on the web focused primarily on spatial information and related topics, concepts and tasks. We call this a meta-MOOC because it lists other meaningful open online content. You may check out the <a href="/lessons" class="view">lessons</a> we have collected.
